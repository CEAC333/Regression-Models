## Motor Trend Analysis

In this report, we are going to analyze the differnces between the manual versus automatic transmission.
There will be quanitifications to analyze the data in order to determine the difference on a set 
of variables and miles per gallon. This is a dataset that is extracted from the automotive
information on 1973-1974. The dataset determines that the cars that have automatic transmissions have
higher MPGs on average than the manual transmissions. Based on the information that is given in the
graphs, it has been determined that the manual transmission vehicles have 7 MPG more than the 
automatic transmission given on average. 


# Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Selection

In this analysis, we are going to load the ggplot 2, and lattice in order to determine the data.
The analysis is going to determine which cars are better for MPG by comparing the automatic versus the manual transmission.

Findings:

Based on all the models below on the appendix, it has been determined that the cars with the manual transmission gets about get an additional 1.8MPG more than the automatic transmission. There is a difference in comparisons with the change in mpg that is making causes from all the other factors such as horsepower, cylinders, and weight to compensate for the data involving in cars.




## Statistical Inference

In this section, we are going to do a t-test in order to analyze the differences between the different
types of transmissions in comparison the the MPG. 

```r
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
```

```r
Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  mpg by am
t = -3.7671, df = 18.332, p-value = 0.001374
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
  -11.280194  -3.209684
sample estimates:
  mean in group 0 mean in group 1 
17.14737        24.39231 
```

Conclusions:
With the differences on the p-values being less than one for the base model and the regular model vehicles, it has been determined that the p-values are almost close to zero. So, based on the sample tests, it can be indicated that we can reject the null hypothesis in order to show that both the manual and automatic transmissions are almost close to identical. It has been determined that the 
cars data have come from different sets of data.

Based on the graphs that are given, it has been determined that the normal QQ graph has the 
normal distribution that is fitting to the intervals between [-1,1]. For all the points on the graphs, it has been determined that they are all the differences on leverage points being distributed between the fitted values and quantities on all four graphs.

# Correlations Between Automatic and Manual Transmissions

In this graph, there will be a difference of interpretations with the diffferences between the 
mpg, wt, and am transmissions.
